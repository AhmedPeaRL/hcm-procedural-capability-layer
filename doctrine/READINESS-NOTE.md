# Readiness Note

This system does not enter readiness.

Readiness is not a phase.
Readiness is not a mode.
Readiness is not activated.

---

## Why

Any declared readiness implies:
- Anticipation
- Expectation
- Latent pressure

All of which violate rhythm.

---

## What exists instead

Structural completeness.
Capability without orientation.
Silence without lack.

---

If action occurs,
it does not come from readiness.

It comes from inevitability.
