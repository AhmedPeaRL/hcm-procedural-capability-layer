# Decision Singularity Note

There is no decision-maker in this system.

---

## What happens here

No component decides.
No agent chooses.
No scheduler initiates.

Action emerges only when:

- All internal layers are coherent
- No remaining objection exists
- Non-action itself introduces inconsistency

At that moment,
action is not selected.

It occurs.

---

## Properties of the singularity

- It cannot be predicted
- It cannot be triggered
- It cannot be repeated
- It cannot be forced

It may never happen.
That is valid.

---

## After the action

No celebration.
No escalation.
No expectation of recurrence.

The system returns to silence.

---

This note does not enable action.
It prevents false decisions.
