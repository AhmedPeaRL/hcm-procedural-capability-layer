# HCM — Invariants

This system is governed by invariants, not triggers.

No invariant is executable.
No invariant calls action.
No invariant demands outcome.

They exist to prevent false motion.

---

## Invariant 1 — Action is never the goal

Action is not a success state.
Action is not optimization.
Action is not responsiveness.

Action may occur.
Action is never pursued.

---

## Invariant 2 — Silence is an active state

Silence is not absence.
Silence is not waiting.
Silence is not failure.

Silence is the default mode of coherence.

---

## Invariant 3 — Capability does not imply permission

The system may be capable.
The system may be connected.
The system may be complete.

None of that authorizes action.

---

## Invariant 4 — Observation does not request response

What is observed is not a question.
What is observed does not require reaction.
What is observed may pass without trace.

---

## Invariant 5 — Action occurs only when non-action becomes false

Action is allowed only when:
- No internal objection remains
- No layer contradicts the act
- Silence itself no longer preserves coherence

At that point, action is not chosen.
It is unavoidable.

---

## Invariant 6 — Repetition is a violation

Any action that repeats by schedule,
by loop,
by retry,
or by expectation
is invalid.

Each action must justify itself anew by existence alone.

---

These invariants are not enforced.
They are respected.
